# CSCI 141
  # Fall 2024 
  ## Lab 0: Getting everything set up
  ## Due Date: Ungraded


### Purpose
The purpose of this lab is meant to introduce you to the tools we'll be using this quarter. If you have questions, be sure to ask the TA. Labs are your opportunity to get personalized help! The first week of classes you won't have in-person labs, so read this document so you can hit the ground running.

### Collaboration in Lab
You are encouraged to work together with your peers in completing the
labs; you can discuss problems with a lab partner. In lab, you are allowed to look at other
students' code and discuss solutions with your peers. **However, the
Python submission that you upload to Canvas must be your own. Don't copy and paste or type exactly what you see on another student's screen.** 

The important thing to remember is that when you work together with classmates the goal is to *understand* what's going on and not just complete the task as quickly as possible. If by the time you're done, you could not sit down and write the code you've submitted by
yourself without help from anyone else (or any AI), you have both done your future self a disservice *and* violated academic honesty. Since programming has many ways to solve each problem, your code should never be exactly the same as another student's (with the exception of this very simple lab). Each lab is designed to help you with the assignments: spend the time to really understand what is happening!

For in-person lab times, go to the assigned room. Should the labs be moved online for any reason, the TA will notify you.

### Zoom
Zoom is used occasionally as circumstances arise, both for lab and for lecture. To be ready, start by either installing Zoom, or try using Zoom through the browser. Test out your microphone, video camera, chat, and screensharing. Take time now to get familiar with Zoom so it is smooth when it's time to use it. The Zoom website has many tutorials and help videos.

Zoom calls can also be joined by phone. If you wish to do so, check the syllabus for more information about call in number (or email your TA/professor).

Often in lecture we'll do in class exercises - the prompts will be posted for reference. Find the link on Canvas under the 'General' tab for the in class exercises folder and make sure you can see the files.

### Backing up your files

We strongly recommend you store all your files on your WWU Office 365 OneDrive in a CSCI141 folder, and share that folder with the professor and your TA. This means that even if you face a technology issue near a deadline, your files can still be retrieved. What a stress saver! The easiest way to do this is to install the OneDrive app, which will automatically keep your files synced: [[https://products.office.com/en-us/onedrive/download]] , but you can manually upload at the end of each day also using a link from office.com . Create a folder and share it now. For help with sharing, check out [[https://bit.ly/2XfCQLh]] .

You should get into the habit of organizing and placing your files into folders for each lab and assignment. The first question the TA or Professor will ask when you say you forgot to upload your work, or uploaded the wrong file, or the file got corrupted is: do you have it in your OneDrive folder? If the answer is 'yes', it's a pretty easy recovery. (If not, you may be out of luck and have to take a late penalty). In general the Professor and TA won't look at your folder unless you need help retrieving a file to turn in.

Of course, you could also store your files in a Github or Gitlab repository! These have a bit more of a learning curve, but are used extensively throughout the CS course sequence, so it's not a bad idea to start getting used to them. Keep your repositories private from other students, and share them to the professor or TA as needed.
 
### Canvas
Everything for this class will be posted on Canvas. If you have trouble finding something, let the professor know!

You can set up your notification preferences in Canvas, or even install the app on your phone for quick lookup and push notifications. Check out the notification preferences at [[https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/Student-Getting-Started-Resources/ta-p/579371]] and configure them the way you like.

You should always use Canvas to send messages to the Professor (this helps prevent messages getting lost in her email inbox). You can send a test message for this lab to try it out! While Canvas messages are typically responded to within a business day or two, if the situation is urgent, try reaching out to your TA first, talking to the professor before or after class, or coming to office hours.

### Assignments and labs
All assignments and labs will be posted to Canvas. Most will require you to submit a file by 11:00 pm PST, although a 59 minute grace period has been added for technical troubles. Double check that you submitted the file you intended and that it uploaded correctly - you are responsible for submitting the correct file on time. If you have trouble past this, send the Professor or TA a message - ideally your work will be saved in your OneDrive folder so the 'last worked on' time can be confirmed. Look for the 'Test Submission 1' assignment and upload an empty text file to practice this process. 

Notice that you can re-submit to the same assignment in case of making a mistake. It is recommended that you submit your work as you go - only the last one before the deadline will be graded, and in case of some disaster, this means that you can get partial credit on work completed to date. Try re-submitting the test assignment now! 

The due dates and times for all work is already on Canvas - take a moment now to record the major assignment dates into your personal calendar or organizational tool. Double check that none of the exam times conflict with other classes or other major obligations, as you must notify the professor within the first two weeks for planned absences.

### Exercise groups
You can use the class Discord to find people who would make good exercise group members with you - and then join the group on the class Canvas page (see 'People' and 'Groups'). You can also quit a group from that page at any time and join a different group if your group has members who are not contributing productively to your learning).

### Textbook
We'll use 'Think like a Computer Scientist' as our free book for this class. You can join the class to track your progress here: [[https://runestone.academy/runestone/default/user/login]] class name CSCI141F24 . Use your W# as your username and password, then change your password once you've logged in. If you joined the class after the first day, you may need to send a Canvas message to the Professor to get added.

You can find the schedule of readings linked to from the front page of Canvas. Note that the topics and readings may be updated during the quarter so if you print it you'll want to check back periodically (better yet, just rely on the digital version).

### Discord
Discord is a place to discuss the material, post questions, and even do voice or video chat! It's free, and you can visit it in your browser, install the program, or get the app for your phone. It's not required to join the class discord, however, it is highly recommended. 

You can join at  the link posted on Canvas. Join now and post a message to the lab0 channel introducing yourself. If you have trouble joining, let your TA know.

### Submission and rubric

That's it for this week's lab---don't worry if this seemed simple: future
labs will be more involved. While designed to be mostly completed during the lab time, some may require up to 2-4 additional hours. If you are struggling to complete your labs on time, talk to your TA or professor about strategies. The labs are designed to prepare you for the larger assignments so be sure to do them in a timely manner!

This lab is ungraded and doesn't have a due date, but it's recommended that you complete it before your next lab! Be sure to read the rubric on future labs closely. 

### Read the Syllabus
Always read the class manual, of course, but this section is actually about the secret extra credit available to students who read class materials carefully: Find an error in class materials? Spot a place on the Canvas with outdated or inaccurate information? Notice a spot in a posted video where quarter-specific information is said (`This Wednesday turn in A2') or the professor has a sneezing fit (or anything else that ought to be edited out?). Tell the professor and you can unlock bonus extra credit*!


*Number of points and assignment it gets applied to is at the discretion of the Professor. Only valid for first person to report it. A record of your balance is kept in the 'Bug Bounty' assignment on Canvas. Additional terms and conditions may apply. Not valid in New Jersey.
